## ðŸ§  Learning GitHub

I'm getting used to GitHub.  
The concepts are a little new to me, but I'm starting to get the hang of it.

### ðŸ”€ Topics I'm Exploring
- Branching
- Forking

I'm especially curious to see how these concepts are used to **efficiently collaborate**.  
This should become clearer as we progress through the course.
